# SPARK Document Management System - QR Integration & Hugging Face Implementation

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented QR code integration with Supabase real-time features and replaced Azure AI with Hugging Face's Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model for document processing.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. QR Code Integration with Supabase
- **PC Interface**: Updated existing QRUpload component to generate QR codes linked to mobile upload sessions
- **Mobile Interface**: Created dedicated mobile upload page at `/mobile-upload` route
- **Real-time Integration**: Implemented Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant file appearance on PC
- **Session Management**: Secure session-based upload system with expiry (24 hours)

#### 2. Supabase Configuration
- **Environment Setup**: Configured with provided Supabase credentials
- **Database Schema**: Created `uploads` table with required columns (id, session_id, file_name, etc.)
- **Storage Bucket**: Set up `uploads` storage bucket for file storage
- **Real-time Features**: Enabled real-time subscriptions for live updates

#### 3. Hugging Face AI Integration
- **Service Replacement**: Completely replaced Azure AI with Hugging Face service
- **Model Integration**: Implemented Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct for document processing
- **Document Parsing**: Added comprehensive document parsing with JSON output format
- **Template Matching**: Supports 5 document types (Earned Leave, Medical Leave, Probation Letter, Punishment Letter, Reward Letter)

#### 4. Document Processing Pipeline
- **Vision Processing**: Uses Hugging Face vision model for text extraction
- **Field Extraction**: Extracts structured data according to document type
- **Stamp & Signature Detection**: Basic verification capabilities
- **Template Mapping**: Automatic field mapping to document templates

#### 5. Mobile Upload Features
- **File Upload**: Supports images (JPEG, PNG) and PDF files (max 10MB)
- **Real-time Status**: Shows upload progress and processing status
- **Session Validation**: Validates QR session before allowing uploads
- **Upload History**: Displays recent uploads for the session

#### Key Services
1. **huggingFaceService.ts**: Handles document processing with Qwen model
2. **qrUploadService.ts**: Manages upload sessions and file handling
3. **supabaseService.ts**: Updated with real-time features and storage

#### Document Processing Prompt
Implemented comprehensive document parsing prompt with:
- Temperature: 0.3 for consistent outputs
- Built-in vision model capabilities
- No external OCR dependencies
- JSON-only responses
- Support for 5 document types with specific field extraction

### 📱 User Experience Flow
1. **PC User**: Generates QR code in Mobile Upload section
2. **Mobile User**: Scans QR code → Opens mobile upload interface
3. **File Upload**: Selects and uploads document (with validation)
4. **Real-time Update**: File immediately appears in PC interface
5. **Processing**: Document processed with Hugging Face AI
6. **Template Matching**: Fields extracted and mapped to templates

### 🔧 Environment Configuration
```bash
# Supabase
