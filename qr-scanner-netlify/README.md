# QR Scanner for SPARK Document Management System

This is a standalone QR scanner web application designed to be deployed on Netlify. It allows mobile users to scan QR codes generated by the SPARK system and get redirected to the document upload interface.

## Features

- 📱 Mobile-optimized QR code scanner
- 📷 Camera-based scanning with auto-detection
- 🔒 Secure session handling
- 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight
- 🌐 Works on all modern mobile browsers

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)

1. **Prepare the files:**
   - Copy this entire `qr-scanner-netlify` folder
   - Zip the contents (not the folder itself, just the files inside)

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login to your account
   - Click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"
   - Drag and drop the zip file or select files
   - Your site will be deployed with a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

3. **Configure the redirect URL:**
   - Open `index.html` in the deployed site
   - Find line 185: `const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:5173';`
   - Replace `http://localhost:5173` with your main SPARK application URL
   - Re-deploy the updated files

### Option 2: Deploy to Any Static Host

This scanner can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Firebase Hosting
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Any web server

Simply upload the files and update the redirect URL as mentioned above.

## Configuration

### Important: Update the Redirect URL

Before deployment, you MUST update the redirect URL in `index.html`:

```javascript
// Line ~185 in index.html
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:5173'; // <-- CHANGE THIS
```

Replace with your actual SPARK application URL:
```javascript
const baseUrl = 'https://your-spark-app.com'; // Your actual domain
```

### URL Structure

The scanner expects QR codes with this format:
```
https://your-qr-scanner.netlify.app/?session=SESSION_ID_HERE
```

When scanned, it redirects to:
```
https://your-spark-app.com/mobile-upload?session=SESSION_ID_HERE
```

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Open `index.html` in a web server (not file://)
2. Use tools like:
   - `python -m http.server 8000`
   - `npx serve .`
   - VS Code Live Server extension

### Mobile Testing
1. Deploy to Netlify (get HTTPS URL)
2. Test on actual mobile devices
3. Ensure camera permissions work correctly
